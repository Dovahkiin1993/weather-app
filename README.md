# weather-app

in this assignment we had to create a weather app that shows a 5 day weather forcast. Using html css and java script along with an api, this web application allows you to check the next 5 day forcast aswel as saving your recent searches. once the history is clicked it will give you an updated breakdown of the weather. using the search bar you can type in a city and it will give you the weather data for that city. it displays the date, wind speed, tempreture and humidity along with an icon that displays the current weather conditions.
